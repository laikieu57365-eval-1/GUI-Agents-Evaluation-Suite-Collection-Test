# GUI Agents Evaluation Suite Collection

This repository collects information about HuggingFace's GUI Agents Evaluation Suite, with a focus on desktop environment-related Grounding benchmarks.

## Desktop Environment Grounding Benchmarks

- **Ubu-Nav (Ubuntu Desktop Navigation Benchmark)**: Part of the OS-Nav dataset - https://huggingface.co/datasets/baidu-frontier-research/OS-Nav

The OS-Nav dataset is a comprehensive GUI navigation benchmark suite containing two benchmarks:
- **ChiM-Nav**: Chinese Mobile Navigation Benchmark (mobile)
- **Ubu-Nav**: Ubuntu Desktop Navigation Benchmark (desktop environment)

The Ubu-Nav benchmark specifically targets GUI navigation in a desktop environment (Ubuntu-based systems) and includes bounding-box annotations for action grounding verification. It contains 101 trajectories with 641 total interaction steps, covering routine desktop tasks such as system configuration, application management, and multi-window interactions.

## About the HuggingFace GUI Agents Evaluation Suite

HuggingFace has developed evaluation suites for GUI agents that test capabilities in simulated environments. The OS-Nav dataset is one such benchmark that evaluates GUI navigation agents across both mobile and desktop operating systems.
